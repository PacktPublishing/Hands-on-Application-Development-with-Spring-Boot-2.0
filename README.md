## About the Video Course
The Spring framework provides great flexibility for Java development, but it also results in tedious configuration work. Spring Boot addresses Spring's configuration difficulties and makes it easy to create standalone, production-grade Spring-based applications.

This course provides a hands-on approach to building a Stock Portfolio application from scratch using Spring Boot. You will begin by installing Spring Boot and using Spring Boot CLI to start your first project. Then you will learn to design code with Dependency Injection and configure classes. Next you’ll learn to configure data sources and convert your data objects into fully fledged entities. Later you’ll learn to use Spring MVC to launch your application over the web and pick the best server using WebFlux. 

Lastly, you will test your application, customize Spring security using the available configuration options and UserDetailsService. Finally, you will deploy your application.
